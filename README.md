# OpenProfile.AI — A Standard for Personal Context Sharing

OpenProfile.AI is an open API standard that enables websites and services to share user-approved personal context — such as preferences, purchases, and behavior — with AI tools and assistants. The goal is to make AI truly personal, by securely connecting data across platforms.

## The Stepped Approach

To make OpenProfile.AI a meaningful and adopted standard, we follow a clear and thoughtful progression:

### 1. Continue research 

We’re actively exploring how facts can be defined, shared, and managed in a privacy-respecting and scalable way.

### 2. Find allies 

We're looking for like-minded people — both on the business side and among AI assistant developers — to explore the standard together.

### 3. Validate integration models 

We're prototyping how assistants would connect to a Facts Pod and work with shared data.

### 4. Define the schema 

A common language and structure for facts need to be agreed upon — categories, metadata, flags, lifecycles.

### 5. Create plugins 

Easy-to-install packages for WordPress, OpenCart, and other CMSs to enable support for OpenProfile without extra dev time.

## Want to Contribute?

The idea of the OpenProfile.AI standard is in a very early stage.
We’ve just started gathering information about real-world challenges, testing hypotheses, and listening to both businesses and users.
The original idea may evolve. The concept might expand — or get more focused.

So any feedback, relevant experience, or references to similar initiatives are highly appreciated.
