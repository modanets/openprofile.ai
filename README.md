# OpenProfile.AI — A Standard for Personal Context Sharing

OpenProfile.AI is an open API standard that enables websites and services to share user-approved personal context — such as preferences, purchases, and behavior — with AI tools and assistants. The goal is to make AI truly personal, by securely connecting data across platforms.

## 🚀 The Stepped Approach

To make OpenProfile.AI a meaningful and adopted standard, we follow a clear and thoughtful progression:

---

### 🧭 1. Explore & Define the Problem

Before jumping into specs, we're taking time to:

- Gather real-world use cases  
- Map fragmented user data across apps and services  
- Understand privacy, consent, and security implications  
- Interview potential adopters (AI tool builders, service owners)

We’re polishing the **problem statement**, not just building for the sake of building.

---

### ✍️ 2. Draft the Standard

Once the problem space is mature and focused, we will:

- Define minimal, composable API endpoints (like `/me/facts`, `/catalog`)  
- Propose data formats and schemas (inspired by [schema.org](https://schema.org))  
- Ensure privacy-first design and consent-driven access  
- Iterate based on feedback

---

### 🧩 3. Build the Ecosystem

After the standard is drafted, we’ll:

- Create **reference implementations** and developer tooling  
- Invite contributors to build **free open-source plugins** for popular platforms  
  (e.g. Shopify, WordPress, WooCommerce, Strapi, custom e-commerce engines)  
- Offer guides, SDKs, and validators
